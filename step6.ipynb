    "When one designs a trading strategy, one should try to exploit all patters available, the residuals (the difference between our predictions and the actual returns) should be random, what the BDS tells me that the P&L can't is whether I'm missing patterns that I could use to increase my returns, specifically it tells me of I'm missing nonlinear patterns. The fact that the $p-value$ of the BDS test is high tells me that my residuals are random (independently and identically distributed), it tells me that my model is somehow complete since the difference between my predictions and reality do not exhibit any pattern.\n",

    "Indeed, correlation spikes during crisis, however one needs to keep in mind that correlation only talks about the short-term linear relationship between the pairs, while co-integration is about a long-term, equilibrium/mean-reversal relationship between the two assets in the pair. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the cointegration is done, in a long timescale compared to that of correlation spikes (years instead of weeks) that in itself tells us we're not merely looking at correlation. On the technical side, the Engle-Granger test was performed, this test checks that the the each of the assets individually, undergoes unpredictable movements (it's non-stationary), for a pair to be cointegrated both time series need to be non-stationary, this was check with the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF), we then use linear regression to find a linear combination of their prices that is stationary (that is it moves around some value, we call  this behaviour mean reverting), again this was checked with ADF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest pitfall is what is known as \"spurious regression\", this happens when we confuse a long-term correlation with cointegration, while in theory the ADF test saves us from this however, the linear regression might be a bit off, or changes in the pair assets, macro or other disruptive events, might break down the relation between the series, so one should always keep checking for cointegration to avoid trading what might be a broken strategy.\n"

The residuals were failing the  ADF test as the p values were too high. The problem itself had to do with the way the ADF test is done in the statmodels library, basically there are several types of regression on which one can look for the residuals, the default value was not appropiate in this case, by reading the documentation and changing the default value I was not only able to solve the problem but better understand the data and the reasons the cointegration strategy doesn't do so good here, the reason is that the data is only cointegrated if the data had no drift, but it does have a small downward drift up to march 2020. Understanding this fail allowd me to understand how strong the conintegration is in this case (based on how general the regression is in each case)\n",
